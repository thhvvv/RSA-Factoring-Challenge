RSA is a popular public-key cryptography algorithm that is widely used for secure communication over the internet. The security of the RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

The RSA algorithm involves the selection of two large prime numbers, p and q, and the multiplication of these primes to obtain a larger number, n = p * q. The security of RSA is based on the assumption that it is difficult to factor this large number into its constituent primes.

To encrypt a message, the sender uses the recipient's public key to transform the message into an unreadable form. The recipient can then use their private key to decrypt the message back into its original form. The security of the RSA algorithm relies on the fact that the private key cannot be derived from the public key.
